**True Sight** is a news credibility checker platform that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to validate news submitted by users. App was available on Android using an API deployed on Google Cloud Run. I was in charge of designing the **Google Cloud** infrastructure. Created as the final project of the [Bangkit Academy 2022](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/) program with five other teammates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è DC Motor Speed Control with EKF & PI-PSO

<img src="blokDiagram.png">

A program to estimate and control the speed of a non-linear *DC Motor* without using speed sensors, only electrical sensors. The estimation was done using the ***Extended Kalman Filter*** (EKF) while the motor was controlled by a PI controller, tuned using the ***Particle Swarm Optimization*** (PSO) algorithm. The program was made using MATLAB scripts and Simulink. Created as my **final project** in university.
