Ever since the 6th semester of college, I've decided pursue *software engineering* for my career instead of *electrical engineering*, which is what I majored in. And even though I made this decision 2 years ago, I've only put this into practice 3 months ago when I graduated college and joined a coding bootcamp.

I've always had a problem with staying consistent. I tend to do things in short, concentrated bursts, ending with a long period of time where I do nothing. However, when I joined the bootcamp things started to change. I was forced to become consistent just by doing the tasks that were provided and I was actually learning some new skills. 

But it's not enough. 4 months isn't nearly enough time to become a good *software engineer*.

That's why I'm starting **#365daysofcode**.

It might seem insane to do **365** days (it is) since the bootcamp ends in under 2 months, but even after I get a job or internship I'm gonna keep learning until I'm skilled enough to work in any of the top compaines in the country. One of my main reasons for pursuing *software engineering* is the independence it brings. Of course I'm not dumb enough to think that it's complete freedom (it's corporate work after all), but compared to the stories I've heard from the traditional engineering world, it's much, much better in that department. Let's just say that it's more skill-based (it would be funny if I end up working in a bank or smth lol). 

I will document my progress in this blog, posting short weekly summaries of the things I've learned, along with some technical articles to help me remember concepts that I struggle with. My aim is to become a **back-end** developer because front-end seems difficult, but idk what will happen. Currently, my main language is **Golang** but I plan to learn Javascript and Java as supplements.

Thank you for your time :)
