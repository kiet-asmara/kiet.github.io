**Error handling** is one of the things I've struggled with the most while learning Go. The issue lies in **where** and **how** to handle these errors. It's mostly agreed upon that it should be done separately from the main application, but there are many ways to do this and it's hard to decide which one is the 'best practice'. So I thought: *why not make a compilation of them?* 

Now, of course I know that it differs from project to project and there is no 'best practice'. I just made this for fun üòÅ.

Let's start with the basics.

## Daisy-chaining

One of the first things I learned in Go, **daisy-chaining** errors is when errors are wrapped with the method or function that they are in. This is used to make *debugging* easier as errors show a clear *trace* when returned. I was really attracted to this idea due to my background of working with PLCs, and the whole concept of a daisy-chain was just neat.

```go
func thisFunction() error {
	err := someFunction()
	return fmt.Errorf("this function: %w", err)
}

func someFunction() error {
	_, err := stringToInt()
	return fmt.Errorf("some function: %w", err)
}

func stringToInt() (int, error) {
	number, err := strconv.Atoi("five")
	if err != nil {
		return 0, fmt.Errorf("string to int: %w", err)
	}
	return number, nil
}

func main() {
	err := thisFunction()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
```
In this example the `thisFunction` calls `someFunction`, which calls another function `stringToInt` that returns an error by default. Each of these errors are followed by the name of the function below it.
```
this function: some function: string to int: strconv.Atoi: parsing "five": invalid syntax
```

This is extremely useful to detect errors that do not return the filename and line of where the error occurred (eg: `app/cmd/main.go:23 main.function()`) and in applications that have many layers. I found it very useful in my project [clothera](/kietpa.id/projects/#clothera), a basic CLI app made with native Go.

Daisy-chaining worked perfectly in that project because a CLI app didn't need to send these errors to higher layer to be handled if it wasn't needed. All you need to do was `fmt.Println(err)` at the same function and it appears in the terminal.

This is why I abandoned this way of error handling once I started building APIs. From seeing other people's code, it was common practice to *standardize* errors by creating custom ones and handling these errors should ideally be *centralized* in one layer. In the top layer, asserting the type of error would be difficult. Also, tracing errors could be done through [logging package](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/issues/63#issuecomment-433746888) using [flags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24809287/how-do-you-get-a-golang-program-to-print-the-line-number-of-the-error-it-just-ca) and whatnot. 

So, daisy-chaining seemed a bit obsolete. If I really wanted to make it work, a lot of effort would be needed for little in return. I thought to just follow the common practice and spend my time learning other things. Maybe I'll come back to this later in the future.

## Custom Errors 

The next error handling method I learned was custom errors. It's not exactly a method, but a *standard*. A separate file would be created to store these errors, also known as **error contracts**. These contracts would then be used to replace common, easily handled errors without needing to parse the error any further as there is already a defined global variable.

```go
import "errors"

var (
	ErrBadRequest      = errors.New("bad request")
	ErrInternalFailure = errors.New("internal failure")
	ErrNotFound        = errors.New("not found")
	ErrFailedBind      = errors.New("failed bind json")
	ErrUnauthorized    = errors.New("access unauthorized")
)
...
```
A basic implementation would include an array of custom errors created by `errors.New()`, which are then easily identfied using the `errors.Is()` and `errors.As()` functions. The errors are passed from the internals to the controllers to be handled in a specific way. For example, `ErrFailedBind` would indicate that the actual error needed to be parsed to display which of the input fields were invalid, whereas `ErrUnauthorized` would return the same message to the user everytime. Below is an example of parsing the `ErrFailedBind`.

```go
var Validate *validator.Validate = validator.New()

// handle binding errors
func ErrorBind(err error) string {
	var ve validator.ValidationErrors
	out := ""
	if errors.As(err, &ve) {
		for _, fe := range ve {
			out = fe.Field() + ": " + msgForTag(fe.Tag())
		}
		return out
	}
	return out
}

// error fields
func msgForTag(tag string) string {
	switch tag {
	case "required":
		return "This field is required"
	case "email":
		return "Invalid email"
	case "alpha":
		return "Must be alphabetical"
	case "gte":
		return "Input too short"
	}
	return ""
}
```
### A New Type
In my experience, a more convenient way of implementing this in an API is to create a whole new type `APIError` that includes the HTTP status code along with the error message.

```go

type APIError struct {
	Code    int
	Message string
}

var (
	ErrInternalServer = APIError{
		Code:    http.StatusInternalServerError, //500
		Message: "Internal Server Error",
	}

	ErrDataNotFound = APIError{
		Code:    http.StatusOK, //200
		Message: "Data Not Found",
	}

	ErrBadRequest = APIError{
		Code:    http.StatusBadRequest, //400
		Message: "Bad request",
	}

	ErrUnauthorized = APIError{
		Code:    http.StatusUnauthorized, //401
		Message: "Request Unauthorized",
	}
)
```
These errors are used all over the handlers, where they are entered into a simple `ErrorMessage` function that logs and returns the error. One of my mentors provided this very simple template in Gin, which he used in his previous job (in a large company).
```go
import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

func ErrorMessage(c *gin.Context, apiError *APIError, err error) *gin.Context {
    log.Println(err)
	c.Abort()
	c.JSON(apiError.Code, gin.H{"error": APIError{
		Code:    apiError.Code,
		Message: apiError.Message,
	}})
	return c
}
```
An example handler:
```go
func AddProduct(c *gin.Context) {
	var product entity.Product

	err := c.BindJSON(&product)
	if err != nil {
		utils.ErrorMessage(c, &utils.ErrBadRequest, err)
		return
	}

	config.DB.Create(&product)

	c.JSON(200, product)
}
```
While this simple approach works well, the way it handles the application error (the actual error) is lacking. There needs to be another function added in some of the handlers which makes it a little messy. 

### Implementing the error Interface

A way to expand on the new error type is to implement the error interface by giving the type an `Error()` method that returns a string of the error. By doing this, it allows you to do some type assertion with `errors.As()` and handle the app errors semi-*gracefully*.

```go
type error interface {
	Error() string
}

```
